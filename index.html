                <span class="tagline">The Ethical Hacker</span>
                <p>This is the path I'm on right now. My focus is on the offensive side of cybersecurity—learning to think like an attacker to build better defenses. This is the plan I'm actively pursuing.</p>

                <h4>The Degree</h4>
                <p>I will complete my <strong>Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Cybersecurity</strong> from UTSA. I'll supplement this with hands-on certifications like the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).</p>

                <h4>Career Trajectory</h4>
                <ul class="future-timeline">
                    <li><strong>Starting Career (2 Years):</strong> I'll start as a <strong>Penetration Tester</strong> or Junior Security Consultant at a specialized cybersecurity firm. My job will be to legally hack into client systems to find vulnerabilities, working as part of a "red team."</li>
                    <li><strong>5 Years Post-Graduation:</strong> I aim to be a <strong>Senior Penetration Tester or Red Team Lead</strong>. I would be designing and leading complex hacking simulations against large corporations, testing their defenses against sophisticated attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>10 Years Post-Graduation:</strong> The goal is to found my own firm specializing in <strong>offensive security services</strong>. We would provide elite penetration testing, red teaming, and vulnerability research for top-tier clients, building a reputation as experts in the field.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> My hobbies directly fuel my career: participating in bug bounty programs, competing in Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking competitions, and building a custom home lab to test exploits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Living Situation:</strong> I'll live in a city apartment close to a tech hub. By year 10, I'd hope to own a home with a secure, high-tech network and a dedicated lab for my work and hobbies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> I'll build a strong network within the hacking community. My family will be my anchor, and I'll maintain close friendships with people who understand the demanding, high-stakes nature of my work.</li>
